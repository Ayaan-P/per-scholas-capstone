# FundSync Organization Profile Guide

## Welcome to FundSync

FundSync uses your organization's comprehensive profile to intelligently match you with funding opportunities that align with your mission, programs, and capacity. The more detailed and accurate your profile, the better our matching algorithm can serve you.

## How Profile Information is Used

### Grant Matching
Your profile information is used to:
- **Search for relevant grants**: We use your focus areas, programs, and target populations to search grant databases
- **Score opportunities**: We rate how well each grant aligns with your organization
- **Filter inappropriate grants**: We exclude opportunities that don't fit your constraints

### Example Matching Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Education Nonprofit**
- You specify: Primary focus = "education", target population = "K-12 students", service region = "Los Angeles, CA"
- FundSync finds: Grants from the Department of Education, local foundations supporting LA schools, and programs focused on student achievement

**Scenario 2: Health Organization with Limited Capacity**
- You specify: Grant writing capacity = "limited", preferred grant size = "$50K-$200K"
- FundSync prioritizes: Simpler grants with long application deadlines and realistic deadlines, avoiding mega-grants requiring complex matching funds

**Scenario 3: Grassroots Community Organization**
- You specify: Custom keywords = ["grassroots", "community-led", "participatory"], excluded keywords = ["military", "corporate"]
- FundSync avoids: Military and corporate funders, only shows grants from funders supporting community-based approaches

### 4. FUNDING PROFILE

This section tells us about your organization's grant-seeking capacity and preferences.

#### Grant Writing Capacity
**Options:** limited, moderate, advanced

**Limited** (~1-2 proposals/quarter)
- Staff: Fewer than 5 people
- Few dedicated grant writers
- Benefits from: Shorter applications, longer deadlines, smaller grants
- Example: Grassroots organization with one part-time grant writer

**Moderate** (~3-5 proposals/quarter)
- Staff: 5-20 people
- Some grant writing experience
- Can handle: Standard applications, 90-day deadlines, mid-size grants
- Example: Established nonprofit with grant manager

**Advanced** (6+ proposals/quarter)
- Staff: 20+ people
- Dedicated grant team
- Can handle: Complex multi-year projects, tight deadlines, large grants with matching requirements
- Example: National nonprofit with grant development department

**Why it matters**: We will not recommend grant opportunities your team cannot realistically manage

#### Preferred Grant Size Range
**What to enter:** Minimum and maximum grant amounts your organization prefers

**Min Size Example: $25,000**
- Rationale: Smaller grants aren't worth the administrative effort for this organization
- Application effort: ~40 hours
- ROI must justify staff time

**Max Size Example: $500,000**
- Rationale: Grants larger than this would be difficult to manage
- Requirements often very complex
- Matching fund requirements might be impossible

**Why it matters**: Prevents wasting time on grants that are too small to matter or too large to manage

#### Matching Fund Capacity
**What to enter:** Percentage of grant funds your organization can match locally (%)
- **Example:** 25% means for a $100K grant, you'd contribute $25K locally
- **Options:** 0% (no match), 25%, 50%, 100%
- **Why it matters**:
  - Many government grants require match
  - 25% is typical requirement
  - No match = access to foundations/private funders only

#### Preferred Grant Types
**Select all that apply:**
- **Project-Based:** Funding for specific time-limited projects or initiatives
  - Example: "Fund our 6-month youth mentoring pilot"
  - Timeline: Usually 1-3 years

  - "trauma-informed" (your programs address trauma)
  - "LGBTQ-affirming" (you welcome LGBTQ+ participants)
  - "community-led" (your approach is participatory)
  - "asset-based" (you build on community strengths)
  - "evidence-based" (your programs use proven methods)
- **Why it matters:** Helps us find grants from funders who value your specific approach

#### Excluded Keywords
**What to enter:** Terms describing funding sources you won't accept
- **Examples:**
  - "military" (don't accept DoD funding)
  - "fossil-fuel" (won't accept energy company grants)
  - "corporate" (prefer foundation funding)

### 5. IMPACT & OUTCOMES

This section helps funders understand the difference your organization makes.

#### Key Impact Metrics
**What to enter:** The metrics your organization tracks to demonstrate impact

**Good metric examples:**
- **Students Served:** Current: 250 | Target: 400 | Unit: students
- **Employment Rate:** Current: 75% | Target: 85% | Unit: percent
- **Community Participants:** Current: 1,200 | Target: 2,000 | Unit: participants
- **Cost per Participant:** Current: $500 | Target: $400 | Unit: dollars

- Shows you track what matters

#### Success Stories
**What to enter:** Compelling narratives about individual or community impact

**Good success story format:**
- **Title:** "From Unemployed to Department Manager"
- **Description:** "Maria was unemployed for 18 months when she enrolled in our 12-week training program. She learned advanced administrative skills, received interview coaching, and landed a position as Office Manager at a nonprofit. After 6 months, she was promoted to Department Manager. Today, she earns 45% more than the median entry-level wage and credits the program with changing her life."

**Why it matters:**
- Numbers show scale; stories show impact

- Demonstrates real human change

#### Previous Grants
**What to enter:** Grants your organization has successfully received

**Example:**
- Funder: "California Workforce Development Board"
- Amount: $150,000

## Tips for Completing Your Profile

### 1. Be Specific, Not Vague
❌ **Avoid:** "We help people in the community"
✅ **Instead:** "We provide workforce training to low-income adults ages 18-65 in Los Angeles County, helping them secure jobs paying $18+/hour"

### 2. Use Your Own Language
Don't copy grant language. Use your genuine voice. Funders can tell the difference.

### 3. Be Honest About Limitations
- If you have limited grant writing capacity, say so
- If you're in your first year, don't claim 5 years of experience
- This helps us recommend appropriate grants you can actually manage

### 4. Keep It Current
Review and update your profile annually or when your organization changes:
- New programs launched
- Geographic expansion
- Staff growth
- Mission refinement

### 5. Provide Concrete Examples
- Don't just say "we serve low-income families"
- Say "we serve 200 low-income families annually, with 85% in households earning <200% of federal poverty level"

### 6. Cross-Check for Consistency
- Does your Mission reflect your Focus Areas?
- Do your Programs support your Target Populations?
- Is your Grant Writing Capacity realistic for the number of grants you'll pursue?

## How Matching Works

### The Matching Algorithm

When you search for opportunities, FundSync evaluates each grant across multiple dimensions:

```
Overall Match Score =
  (Keywords Match × 30%) +
  (Semantic Similarity × 40%) +
  (Funding Alignment × 15%) +
  (Deadline Feasibility × 8%) +
  (Demographics Match × 5%) +
  (Geographic Match × 2%)
```

### Component Explanations

**Keywords Match (30%)**
- Does the grant mention your focus areas, programs, or keywords?
- Example: Grant about "job training" + your program is job training = high keyword match

**Semantic Similarity (40%)**
- Compares grant language to your organization's descriptions using AI
- Looks beyond exact keyword matching to understand deeper alignment
- Example: Grant about "economic mobility for underrepresented communities" matches your "workforce training for low-income adults"

**Funding Alignment (15%)**
- Is the grant amount within your preferred range?
- Too small wastes your time; too large might exceed your capacity
- Perfect match = 100 score; outside range = lower score

**Deadline Feasibility (8%)**
- Do you have enough time to complete a quality application?
- Limited capacity organizations get lower scores for tight deadlines

**Demographics Match (5%)**
- Do beneficiaries in the grant description match your target populations?
- Example: Grant specifies "low-income youth" + you serve youth = match

**Geographic Match (2%)**
- Does the grant's geographic focus align with your service region?
- National grants = high match for any region
- Regional grants must match your service area

### Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Meaning | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| 90-100 | Excellent fit | Definitely pursue |
| 75-89 | Very good fit | Strongly consider |
| 60-74 | Good fit | Worth reviewing |
| 45-59 | Moderate fit | Review but lower priority |
| <45 | Poor fit | Lower priority |

## FAQs

### "Should I enter all our secondary programs?"
**Yes!** Each program is an additional way we can match you with grants. A hidden program is a missed grant opportunity.

### "What if my organization serves multiple geographic areas?"
**List them all.** FundSync matches on any of your service regions, so include every city/county/region you serve.

### "Should I put aspirational metrics or current metrics?"
**Always current.** Put your actual metrics in "Current" column and your goals in "Target." Funders want to see growth potential, but they base funding decisions on current reality.

### "What if I don't know some of the information?"
**Estimate reasonably or leave blank.** You can come back and refine later. It's better to complete the profile with estimates than to delay. You can update anytime.

### "Does having 'limited' grant writing capacity hurt our chances?"
**No!** We just make sure to recommend grants you can actually manage. A great grant you apply to is better than 10 grants you're too busy to do well.

### "How often should we update our profile?"
**Quarterly or when major changes occur:**
- New program launched
- Significant staff changes
- New partnership formed
- Geographic expansion
- Major grant award (affects annual budget)

### "Do you sell our information to funders?"
**No.** Your profile is only used by FundSync's algorithm to find matching opportunities. We don't share your detailed information with anyone without your permission.
