Grant writing feels overwhelming at first. You're staring at a blank document, deadline looming, knowing that the funding you need to keep your programs running hangs on whatever comes out of your keyboard next.

Here's the truth: every grant proposal follows a predictable structure. Once you understand that structure — and the logic behind each section — writing becomes a lot less mysterious. You're not crafting something from scratch each time. You're filling in a framework that funders expect to see.

This guide walks you through every section of a grant proposal, what funders actually want to read, and how to avoid the mistakes that get applications sent straight to the rejection pile. Whether you're a first-time grant writer or someone who has submitted dozens of proposals and wants to sharpen their craft, this is the foundation you need.

---

## What Is a Grant Proposal?

A grant proposal is a formal written request for funding from a foundation, government agency, or corporation. It explains who you are, what problem you're trying to solve, how you plan to solve it, and what you need to make it happen.

Funders read hundreds of proposals. They're looking for organizations that clearly understand the problem they're addressing, have a credible plan to address it, and can demonstrate they'll use the money responsibly. Your job is to make all three of those things obvious — quickly.

Most proposals run between five and twenty pages, depending on the funder's requirements. Some foundations want a brief letter of inquiry first. Others want a detailed narrative with supporting attachments. Always read the RFP (Request for Proposals) or application guidelines before you write a single word.

---

## Before You Write: The Research Phase

Writing a grant proposal before you've done your homework is like building a house without a blueprint. You'll waste time and probably get rejected.

### Match the Funder to Your Mission

Not every grant is right for your organization. A foundation that funds early childhood education is not going to fund your senior services program, no matter how compelling your proposal is. Start by identifying funders whose priorities genuinely align with your work.

Resources for finding the right grants:

- **[Grants.gov](https://grants.gov)** — the official database for federal grants. Use the search filters to narrow by category, agency, and eligibility.
- **[Candid/GuideStar](https://candid.org)** — foundation profiles, 990s, and giving histories. Understanding what a funder has previously funded tells you a lot about what they'll fund next.
- **[Foundation Directory](https://fconline.foundationcenter.org)** — comprehensive database of private foundations. The paid version is worth it if you're actively seeking grants.
- **[FundFish](https://fundfish.pro)** — AI-powered grant matching for nonprofits. Find grants matched to your specific mission in minutes, not days.

Once you've identified a funder, study them:

- What are their current funding priorities?
- What types of organizations have they previously funded?
- What's their average grant size?
- Do they have a letter of inquiry process before full proposal submission?
- Are there geographic restrictions?

The more you know about a funder before you write, the more precisely you can tailor your proposal. Generic proposals almost always fail.

### Read the Guidelines — Then Read Them Again

Every funder publishes application guidelines. These are not suggestions. They're requirements. If they ask for a budget narrative, include one. If they cap the proposal at five pages, write five pages. If they want a specific font size or margin, use it.

Failing to follow guidelines signals to reviewers that you can't follow instructions. If you can't follow simple formatting rules, why would they trust you to manage a $50,000 grant?

### Start a Prospect Research File

Before you write, build a simple profile of the funder. Note their priorities, past grants, average award amounts, and any specific language they use to describe their work. You'll mirror this language — not copy it, but align with it — throughout your proposal.

---

## The Structure of a Grant Proposal

Most grant proposals contain the same core sections, though their order and emphasis vary by funder. Here's what you'll typically need:

1. Cover Page / Title Page
2. Executive Summary
3. Statement of Need
4. Project Description / Program Narrative
5. Goals and Objectives
6. Evaluation Plan
7. Organizational Capacity
8. Budget and Budget Narrative
9. Sustainability Plan
10. Conclusion
11. Attachments

Let's walk through each one.

---

## Section 1: Cover Page

Simple but important. The cover page typically includes:

- Your organization's legal name
- Address, phone, and website
- Primary contact name and title
- Name of the grant program you're applying for
- Total funding requested
- Project title
- Project period (start and end dates)
- Your organization's tax ID / EIN
- A one-sentence project description

Some funders provide a required cover page form. If they do, use it exactly as designed.

---

## Section 2: Executive Summary

The executive summary is often written last even though it appears first. It's a concise overview — usually one page or less — of the entire proposal.

A strong executive summary covers:

- **Who you are**: Your organization's name, mission, and community served
- **What you're proposing**: The project in one or two sentences
- **The problem**: Why this project is needed
- **The solution**: How your project addresses the problem
- **The ask**: How much funding you're requesting and for what purpose
- **The outcome**: What will be different because of this grant

Write it last, but make it compelling. Many reviewers read the executive summary and then decide how carefully to read the rest. Make them want to keep reading.

**Example:**
*"Riverside Youth Center serves 1,200 young people ages 12–18 in the South River neighborhood, one of Chicago's highest-poverty zip codes. With this $75,000 grant request, we will launch an 18-month after-school STEM mentorship program pairing 150 high school students with local professionals in engineering and technology careers. By program completion, we project that 80% of participants will report increased confidence in STEM subjects and 60% will have completed a college application in a STEM field."*

Notice what that example does: it names the organization, grounds it in a specific community, states the dollar amount, describes the program, and closes with a measurable outcome. Aim for that in one tight paragraph.

---

## Section 3: Statement of Need

This is where you prove the problem exists — and that it's serious enough to warrant funding.

The statement of need (also called the needs assessment or problem statement) should answer: **Why does this project need to exist?**

This is not the place to describe your organization or your program. It's about the community problem you're addressing. Keep the focus on the people you serve, not on your organization.

### Tips for a Strong Needs Statement

**Use data.** Back up your claims with statistics from credible sources — census data, CDC reports, state health department data, academic research, your own program data. Don't say "many young people in our community struggle with food insecurity." Say "In Riverside County, 1 in 4 children — 47,000 kids — experience food insecurity, compared to the national average of 1 in 7 (Feeding America, 2024)."

**Make it local.** National statistics set context, but local data makes the problem feel real. Funders want to know this is a problem in the community you serve, not just everywhere in the abstract.

**Connect the data to your community.** Use your own intake data, client surveys, or case studies to illustrate the human reality behind the numbers.

**Avoid circular logic.** Don't say "the need is that we don't have funding for this program." That's not a community need — that's an organizational budget gap. The need is what happens in your community because the problem isn't being addressed.

**Keep it tight.** Two to three pages is typical. Some funders cap it at one. Don't overwhelm reviewers with data. Give them enough to understand the severity of the problem, then move on.

---

## Section 4: Project Description (Program Narrative)

Now you get to describe what you're actually going to do. This is usually the longest section of the proposal.

The project description should answer:

- **What** activities will you carry out?
- **Who** will benefit?
- **How** will the work be done?
- **When** will each activity happen?
- **Where** will the work take place?

### Be Specific

Funders don't fund vague intentions. "We will provide programming to youth in our community" tells them nothing. "We will run weekly two-hour STEM workshops at Lincoln Middle School for 50 7th-grade students, led by two credentialed educators, from September through June" — that's specific enough to evaluate.

### Tell a Story, Then Back It Up

The best program narratives weave together narrative and evidence. Lead with the human experience — what a participant's day looks like in your program — then ground it in research that shows this approach works.

### Include a Timeline

A simple project timeline (you can describe it in prose or use a table) reassures funders that you've thought through implementation. Show them when activities will start, key milestones, and when outcomes will be measured.

### Name Your Key Staff

Who will run this program? Briefly describe the qualifications of your program director, key staff, and any partners. You don't need full bios here (those go in the attachments), but funders want to know the program isn't resting on one overextended volunteer.

---

## Section 5: Goals and Objectives

Goals are broad outcomes you're aiming for. Objectives are specific, measurable steps you'll take to achieve those goals.

A common framework is **SMART objectives**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

**Weak objective:** "Participants will gain job skills."

**Strong objective:** "By June 30, 2026, 40 participants will complete the 12-week culinary training program, and 75% will pass the ServSafe food handler certification exam."

Write two to four goals for most proposals. Under each goal, list two to four specific objectives. This structure makes your evaluation plan much easier to write — because you've already told the funder exactly what success looks like.

---

## Section 6: Evaluation Plan

Funders want to know you'll track whether the program is working. The evaluation section describes how you'll measure success.

Cover these questions:

- **What will you measure?** Link directly to your objectives.
- **How will you collect data?** Surveys, pre/post assessments, attendance records, follow-up interviews, database tracking?
- **Who will conduct the evaluation?** Your own staff? An external evaluator?
- **When will data be collected?** At intake, mid-program, end of program, six months post-program?
- **How will you use the findings?** To improve the program? To inform future grant reports?

You don't need a PhD-level research design. What you do need is evidence that you take learning seriously and that you have a realistic plan for knowing whether your program is working.

For grants over $100,000, some funders require an independent evaluator. Plan for that in your budget.

---

## Section 7: Organizational Capacity

This section answers the funder's implicit question: **Can this organization actually pull this off?**

Include:

- A brief history of your organization (one paragraph)
- Your mission and the population you serve
- The scale of your current work (number of clients, programs, annual budget)
- Relevant past experience — similar programs you've run successfully
- Key partnerships that strengthen this project
- Relevant awards, accreditations, or external recognition

Keep this section brief — one to two pages. It's supporting evidence, not the star of the proposal. The program is the star. Your capacity section just needs to reassure funders you're a credible organization.

---

## Section 8: Budget and Budget Narrative

The budget is where proposals often fall apart — not because organizations are dishonest, but because budgets are unclear.

### The Budget Table

Present a clear, line-item budget showing:

- **Personnel** — salaries and benefits for all staff charged to the grant, including the percentage of their time this grant funds
- **Fringe benefits** — typically a percentage of salary (15–25% is common)
- **Consultants/contractors** — if you're hiring external experts
- **Supplies and materials** — be specific (not "miscellaneous")
- **Equipment** — any major purchases
- **Travel** — mileage, conferences, site visits
- **Indirect/overhead costs** — check the funder's policy; some cap indirect costs at 10–15%
- **Subtotals and total request**

Also include a column for **other funding sources** if the project has a larger total budget than you're requesting. This shows funders you're not dependent on a single source.

### The Budget Narrative

The budget narrative explains every line item in your table. Don't assume anything is self-explanatory.

**Example:**
*"Program Coordinator (0.5 FTE x $52,000 annual salary = $26,000). The Program Coordinator will spend 50% of their time managing day-to-day program operations, recruiting participants, and coordinating with school partners."*

Write one or two sentences per line item explaining the calculation and the rationale. This is also where you justify costs that might seem high (specialized software, expensive training) or explain any matching funds.

### Budget Tips

**Be realistic, not optimistic.** Underbudgeting is a common mistake. If you underestimate your costs, you'll either have to cut program activities or come back to the funder asking for more money — neither is a good outcome.

**Check the funder's overhead policy.** Some foundations cap indirect costs. Others pay full overhead. Know before you submit.

**Show leverage.** If your organization is contributing staff time, space, or other resources to this project, show that in the budget. It signals organizational commitment and makes your dollar request more credible.

---

## Section 9: Sustainability Plan

Most funders don't want to fund the same program forever. They want to know what happens when their grant ends.

Your sustainability plan should address:

- How will this program be funded after the grant period?
- Are you diversifying your revenue (other grants, earned income, individual donors)?
- Will the program be integrated into your general operating budget?
- Are there plans to scale or replicate it?
- What partnerships might provide in-kind or financial support going forward?

Be honest. If sustainability depends on securing future grants, say so — but also show that you're actively diversifying. Funders know that few nonprofits are fully self-sustaining. What they want to see is a plan, not a wish.

---

## Section 10: Conclusion

End with a brief, strong close. Restate:

- What you're asking for
- What will change in your community because of this grant
- Your organization's commitment to the work
- A thank-you for the funder's consideration

Keep it to one paragraph. Don't repeat everything you've already said — just leave the reviewer with a clear, confident final impression.

---

## Section 11: Attachments

Funders typically ask for supporting documents. Common attachments include:

- IRS determination letter (proof of 501(c)(3) status)
- Most recent audited financial statements
- Current year operating budget
- Board of directors list (names, affiliations, and professional backgrounds)
- Organizational chart
- Letters of support from community partners
- Staff resumes or bios
- Logic model or program diagram
- Evaluation tools (sample surveys, assessment forms)

Only include what the funder requests. Sending a 40-page attachment package when they asked for one page of organizational background doesn't make you look thorough — it makes you look like you didn't read the guidelines.

---

## Common Grant Writing Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

**1. Writing one generic proposal for every funder**
Every proposal should be tailored to the specific funder. That doesn't mean rewriting from scratch each time — it means adjusting the framing, the focus, and the language to match what each funder cares about.

**2. Ignoring page limits and formatting requirements**
Hard limits are hard. One page over signals you can't follow instructions. Set up your document correctly before you write.

**3. Describing your organization instead of the community problem**
Remember: the needs statement is about the people you serve, not about you. Save the organizational history for the capacity section.

**4. Burying the ask**
State clearly and early how much you're requesting and for what. Don't make reviewers hunt for the number.

**5. Weak evaluation plans**
"We will track outcomes" is not a plan. Be specific about what you'll measure, how, and when.

**6. Vague budgets**
Every line item should have a clear calculation and rationale. Don't lump things together under "miscellaneous."

**7. Submitting without proofreading**
Typos, inconsistent numbers, or wrong funder names in the text (because you copied from another proposal and forgot to update) kill credibility fast. Have someone who didn't write the proposal read it before submission.

**8. Missing the deadline**
Most funders will not accept late submissions. Build your calendar backward from the deadline, giving yourself buffer for unexpected delays.

---

## Tips for First-Time Grant Writers

**Start with small, local funders.** Community foundations and local corporate foundations often have simpler applications and more accessible program officers. Build your track record there before going after large federal grants.

**Talk to program officers.** Many funders encourage pre-submission conversations. A 15-minute call with a program officer can tell you more about what they want than an hour of reading their website. Ask if your project is a good fit before you invest weeks in writing.

**Build a proposal library.** Every section you write well is a section you can adapt for the next proposal. Maintain a library of your best needs statements, program descriptions, and evaluation narratives. Don't start from scratch every time.

**Track your submissions.** Use a simple spreadsheet or grant management tool to track funder names, deadlines, submission dates, award amounts, and outcomes. This data helps you improve over time and avoid missing renewal deadlines.

**Learn from rejections.** Not every rejection is a bad fit or a bad proposal. Sometimes it's competition for limited funds. When possible, ask for feedback on rejected proposals — some funders will share reviewer comments, which are invaluable for your next submission.

---

## How AI Is Changing Grant Writing

More nonprofits are using AI tools to speed up the grant writing process — drafting sections, summarizing research, and suggesting language. AI can help you work faster, but it can't replace the specific knowledge you have about your community, your program, and your organization.

Use AI as a writing assistant, not as a grant writer. The funder wants to hear your voice and your organization's expertise. Generic AI-generated content reads as generic. Ground everything in your real data, real stories, and real outcomes.

Where AI genuinely helps: synthesizing research for needs statements, drafting first versions of boilerplate sections (organizational history, sustainability plan), and proofreading for clarity and consistency.

---

## The Grant Proposal as a Relationship Tool

Think of a grant proposal not just as a funding application but as the beginning of a relationship with a funder. Even if you don't receive funding on your first submission, a well-written proposal can open the door to future conversations.

Follow up after submission — not to chase a decision, but to thank them for the opportunity and express continued interest in their work. If you receive funding, send timely, thorough reports. If you're rejected, ask if you can reapply in the future.

Many of the strongest funder-grantee relationships started with a rejection. Play the long game.

---

## Finding the Right Grants to Apply For

Writing a strong proposal is only half the work. The other half is finding the right grants in the first place.

Start with these resources:

- **[Grants.gov](https://grants.gov)** — federal grants across all agencies and program areas
- **[Candid/Foundation Directory Online](https://candid.org)** — the gold standard for private foundation research
- **[GivingCompass](https://givingcompass.org)** — funder intelligence for nonprofits
- **[FundFish](https://fundfish.pro)** — AI-powered grant discovery that matches your mission to open opportunities. Instead of spending hours searching databases, FundFish surfaces the grants most likely to fund your work. Find grants matched to your mission.

The more targeted your search, the better your odds. Applying for twenty well-matched grants beats applying for a hundred long shots every time.

## Quick Checklist Before You Submit

Before hitting send, run through this checklist:

- [ ] Did I read the funder's guidelines in full?
- [ ] Does my project fit their current priorities?
- [ ] Is the ask amount within their typical range?
- [ ] Is my needs statement backed by current, local data?
- [ ] Are my objectives SMART?
- [ ] Does my budget narrative explain every line item?
- [ ] Is my sustainability plan realistic?
- [ ] Did I include all required attachments?
- [ ] Is the proposal under the page limit?
- [ ] Has someone else proofread it?
- [ ] Is it submitted before the deadline?

## Final Thoughts

Grant writing gets easier with practice. The first proposal feels like climbing a mountain. By the tenth, you have a system, a library of reusable content, and a much clearer sense of what funders are looking for.

The fundamentals don't change: know your community's need, have a credible plan to address it, show you can execute, and make it easy for the reviewer to say yes.

Start with the framework in this guide. Build from real data and real outcomes. Tailor every proposal to the specific funder. And keep at it — because the most important thing you can do for the communities you serve is keep showing up with a strong ask.
