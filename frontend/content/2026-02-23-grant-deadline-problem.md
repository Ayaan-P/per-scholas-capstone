Here's a scenario that happens at nonprofits every week:

A program director discovers a perfect grant — right mission fit, right funding range, right funder. They bookmark it. They mean to come back to it. Then a board meeting runs long, a staff crisis comes up, end-of-quarter reports land... and two weeks later they get an email from a colleague:

*"Did you see the XYZ Foundation deadline was yesterday?"*

The grant was winnable. The organization qualified. The deadline was **predictable** weeks in advance. And they still missed it.

This isn't a discipline problem. It's a systems problem.

## The Real Cost of Missed Deadlines

Most grant cycles run once a year. Some run twice. A missed deadline isn't just a lost opportunity — it's a **12-month setback**.

And unlike sales pipelines, grant pipelines have hard stops. You can't follow up after the deadline and ask for an extension. The cycle closes, scores go to the funder's committee, and the money goes somewhere else.

We've talked to enough nonprofit development directors to know this is one of their biggest pain points. Not finding grants — they often know what's out there — but staying organized enough to actually apply.

## Why Grant Databases Don't Help

Traditional grant databases solve the discovery problem. They don't solve the deadline management problem.

Most tools let you search, save, and export. That's where they stop. The burden of tracking what you saved, when it's due, and what stage your application is in falls back on spreadsheets — which break down as soon as the lead development staffer changes roles.

We built FundFish to close that gap.

## What We're Building

Starting with the **grant pipeline view** (coming soon), every grant you save in FundFish will move through a lifecycle:

1. **Saved** — You found it, it looks promising
2. **In Progress** — You've started working on the application
3. **Submitted** — Application sent
4. **Awarded** or **Not Awarded** — Outcome tracked

Each stage can hold notes, attachments, and your draft proposal (generated by FundFish's AI proposal writer).

And across all of this: **deadline alerts**.

When a saved grant's deadline is 30 days out, you get an email. At 7 days, you get another. At 48 hours, an urgent alert. The calendar always knows — your inbox is just the delivery mechanism.

## The Compounding Effect of Good Tracking

Here's what we find interesting: nonprofits that track grant outcomes — not just wins but losses — get better at fundraising over time.

If you know you were rejected twice by foundations that prioritize rural organizations, you stop applying to those funders. If you know your win rate on federal workforce development grants is 40%, you apply to more of those.

Grant data is institutional knowledge. Most nonprofits let it evaporate.

FundFish stores every outcome. Over time, your profile gets smarter — not just at finding grants that match your mission, but at finding grants that match your *track record*.

## A Note on Focus

We're a small team. We ship incrementally.

Deadline alerts and pipeline tracking are next on our roadmap. We're building them because we've heard "I missed a grant I knew about" more times than we can count.
