# How to Find Grants for Nonprofits: A Complete 2024 Guide

Finding the right grant can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack — except the haystack is massive, the needle keeps moving, and every other nonprofit in your city is searching right alongside you.

The good news? The process is learnable. Tens of thousands of nonprofits secure grant funding every year, not because they got lucky, but because they built a repeatable system for identifying, qualifying, and pursuing the right opportunities. This guide gives you exactly that system — from free government databases to AI-powered matching tools — so you can stop guessing and start funding your mission.

## What Is a Nonprofit Grant (and What Isn't)?

Before diving into *where* to look, it's worth clarifying *what* you're actually looking for.

A grant is a non-repayable award of funds given by a foundation, government agency, or corporation to a qualifying organization for a specific purpose. Unlike loans, grants don't need to be paid back. Unlike donations, most grants come with strings attached — reporting requirements, spending restrictions, and performance expectations.

There are four major grant categories you'll encounter:

**Federal government grants** come from agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, or the National Endowment for the Arts. They tend to be large, highly competitive, and require detailed compliance work. But landing one is a major credibility signal.

**State and local government grants** are often overlooked by smaller nonprofits, but they can be easier to win. Local governments frequently prioritize organizations doing work in their specific communities, which gives you a built-in alignment advantage.

**Foundation grants** come from private or public philanthropic foundations. Private foundations — think family foundations and major philanthropies — don't solicit donations; they give them. Public foundations aggregate donations from multiple sources and then grant them out. Both are worth pursuing.

**Corporate grants** come from companies investing in social impact aligned with their brand values. These are often more flexible than government grants and can include in-kind support (products, services, employee volunteers) alongside cash.

Understanding which type fits your mission and capacity is the first filter in your search — not the last.

## Step 1: Get Your House in Order Before You Search

A common mistake: nonprofits search for grants before they're actually ready to apply. Then they find a perfect opportunity with a 10-day deadline and scramble — submitting a weak application that doesn't represent their work.

Before you search, assemble your organizational readiness kit:

- **IRS determination letter** (proof of 501(c)(3) status)
- **Current operating budget** (and a program-specific budget if applicable)
- **Board member list** with affiliations
- **Audited financials** (for grants above ~$25,000)
- **Organization's EIN**
- **Mission statement** (crisp, one to two sentences)
- **Impact data and program outcomes** from the last 1–2 years
- **Letters of support** from community partners

Having these ready means when you find a grant, you can apply — not prepare to apply. The organizations that win grants consistently are those that can move quickly without sacrificing quality.

## Step 2: Search the Major Grant Databases

There is no single master list of all available grants. Funding is scattered across hundreds of databases, portals, and websites. Your job is to know the key ones and check them regularly.

### Grants.gov — Federal Funding, All in One Place

[Grants.gov](https://www.grants.gov) is the official federal grants portal. Every federal agency posts its grant opportunities here. You can filter by:

- **Eligibility** (nonprofit organizations, small businesses, individuals)
- **Category** (health, education, environment, arts, community development)
- **Status** (forecasted, open, closed)
- **Agency**

Set up a saved search with email alerts so new opportunities matching your criteria land in your inbox automatically. Federal grants are highly competitive, but they're also the largest in dollar amount — often six or seven figures.

### Candid Foundation Directory — The Gold Standard for Foundation Grants

[Candid](https://candid.org) (formerly Foundation Center + GuideStar) operates the most comprehensive database of private and public grant-makers in the United States. Their Foundation Directory lets you search by:

- Geographic focus
- Subject area and cause
- Grant size
- Applicant type

Candid is a subscription service, but many public libraries offer free access to Foundation Directory Online. Check your local library before paying for a subscription — this alone can save hundreds of dollars per year.

### GrantWatch — Aggregated Opportunities Across All Sources

[GrantWatch](https://www.grantwatch.com) pulls grants from federal, state, local, and private sources into one searchable interface. It includes previews of eligibility requirements and deadlines. Like Candid, it's subscription-based, but the breadth of coverage is useful if you're looking across multiple grant types simultaneously.

### Your State's Grant Portal

Many states maintain their own grant databases. California has the [California Grants Portal](https://www.grants.ca.gov). Other states have similar tools, often maintained by the state's Department of Finance or Office of Grants Management. Search "[your state] nonprofit grant portal" to find it.

State portals often surface opportunities that aren't on Grants.gov or Candid — particularly state-funded initiatives and community foundation partnerships.

### SAM.gov — Required for Federal Applicants

If you intend to apply for any federal grant, your organization must be registered in [SAM.gov](https://www.sam.gov) (System for Award Management). This is free, but registration can take 7–10 business days. Do this *before* you find a grant you want to apply for. Many nonprofits get burned discovering they can't apply in time because they haven't registered.

---

## Step 3: Mine Local Sources That Everyone Else Misses

The biggest missed opportunity for most nonprofits isn't national databases — it's local funding that's easier to win and often more aligned with your work.

### Community Foundations

Almost every mid-sized city and region has a community foundation. These foundations pool philanthropic assets from local donors and then grant them back to local nonprofits. They are explicitly designed to fund organizations doing work in the community.

Use the [Community Foundation Locator](http://www.cof.org/community-foundation-locator) maintained by the Council on Foundations to find the one(s) in your area. Then:

1. Review their current grantmaking priorities
2. Sign up for their newsletter or grant alerts
3. Attend their nonprofit education events (these are networking gold)
4. Reach out to a program officer *before* you apply — a brief email or call can tell you whether your project is a fit and can dramatically improve your application

### United Way Affiliates

Local United Way chapters fund nonprofits in specific program areas (education, income stability, health). Funding tends to be smaller — often $5,000 to $50,000 — but the relationships built through United Way can open doors to other funders in your area.

### Local Corporate Foundations and CSR Programs

Major employers in your region — banks, hospitals, utilities, retailers — often have community grant programs. These are frequently underutilized because they're not in major databases. Go directly to the "Community" or "Corporate Responsibility" section of companies headquartered near you.

---

## Step 4: Use Google Like a Grant Researcher

Free search tools are more powerful than people realize. Some effective search strings:

- `"grants for nonprofits" "[your city or state]" 2024`
- `"request for proposals" "nonprofit" "[your cause area]" site:.gov`
- `"LOI due" OR "letters of intent" "[your program area]" foundation 2024`
- `"[your cause area] foundation" grants "501(c)(3)"`

Set up Google Alerts for terms like "RFP nonprofit [your city]" or "grant opportunity [your program area]" to receive email notifications whenever new opportunities appear online.

## Step 5: Build Relationships Before You Need Them

The single most underrated grant strategy isn't a database — it's a phone call.

Program officers at foundations have enormous discretion. They're the people who read your application and decide whether to fund you. Many experienced grant writers will tell you: the conversation you have *before* submitting an application is often more important than the application itself.

Here's how to build these relationships:

**Attend funder events.** Most community foundations and larger private foundations host information sessions, webinars, or nonprofit summits. These events exist specifically so you can meet program officers.

**Send a brief inquiry email.** A two-paragraph email explaining your organization, your project, and asking whether it aligns with the foundation's current priorities is professional, expected, and appreciated. Most program officers would rather field a quick email than read a lengthy application that doesn't fit.

**Follow foundations on LinkedIn.** Foundation staff post when priorities shift, when new funding cycles open, and when they're attending events. This is free intelligence.

**Cultivate relationships year-round, not just during grant season.** Send program officers your impact reports. Invite them to a program site visit. Tag funders (appropriately) on social media when you achieve outcomes they helped fund. Relationships compound.

---

## Step 6: Qualify Before You Apply

Applying for every grant you find is a path to burnout, not funding. Every application takes time — sometimes 20, 40, or 80 hours for complex federal grants. A basic qualification filter can save you hundreds of hours per year.

Run every prospective grant through this checklist:

| Question | If No → |
|---|---|
| Are we eligible (size, geography, 501(c)(3))? | Skip |
| Does the funder's mission overlap with ours? | Skip |
| Is the funding amount worth our application time? | Skip |
| Can we meet the deadlines and reporting requirements? | Skip |
| Do we have the project capacity to execute if funded? | Skip |

Only pursue grants that pass all five filters. A focused list of 10 well-qualified applications will almost always outperform a scattered list of 30 weak ones.

## Step 7: Let AI Do the Heavy Lifting

The challenge with grant searching has always been time. Manually reviewing dozens of databases, reading through eligibility criteria, and cross-referencing funder priorities against your mission is exhausting — and it's hard to do well while also running programs.

This is where AI-powered tools are changing the game for nonprofits.

Platforms like **FundFish** use AI to:

- **Match your organization's mission to relevant funders** — not just keyword matching, but semantic understanding of what your work actually does and what funders actually care about
- **Surface opportunities across multiple databases** simultaneously, so you don't have to log into five different portals
- **Flag deadline windows** before they close, so you're not constantly reacting
- **Prioritize opportunities** by likelihood of fit, so you spend your limited time on applications worth writing

Traditional grant searches are reactive — you search when you have time and hope you haven't missed the deadline. AI-powered matching is proactive — it brings the right opportunities to you, contextualized to your specific mission and organizational profile.

For small nonprofits with one or two staff members managing the entire development function, this kind of intelligent prioritization isn't a luxury — it's a force multiplier. The organizations winning more grants aren't necessarily better writers. They're finding better-fit opportunities and making smarter decisions about where to invest their application time.

---

## Step 8: Track Everything

Once you're actively pursuing multiple grants, tracking becomes critical. A basic grant tracking spreadsheet should include:

- Funder name and contact
- Grant name and opportunity link
- Amount requested
- Deadline (LOI and/or full proposal)
- Status (researching / intent to apply / submitted / awarded / declined)
- Reporting deadlines (if awarded)
- Notes from funder conversations

Many nonprofits use Airtable, Notion, or even Google Sheets for this. The tool matters less than the habit. Review your tracker weekly. Missing a deadline or reporting requirement can close the door with a funder permanently.

---

## What to Do When You Get a No

Rejection is the norm in grant fundraising. Even well-resourced development offices with experienced staff have acceptance rates of 20–40%. Smaller nonprofits often experience lower initial rates as they build funder relationships.

When you receive a rejection:

1. **Send a thank-you** — genuinely. Acknowledge the funder's time and express continued interest in the relationship.
2. **Ask for feedback** — not every funder will provide it, but many will, especially if you've had a prior conversation with a program officer. Feedback from a declined application is some of the most valuable intelligence you can get.
3. **Re-evaluate fit** — sometimes a no means "not this cycle" or "not this project." Keep the funder on your list for future opportunities that may align better.
4. **Don't over-personalize** — grant rejections are usually about fit, budget, competition, and timing, not about the quality of your organization.

## Final Thought: Grant Funding Is a Relationship Business

The databases, portals, and AI tools are all infrastructure — they help you find the door. But what opens the door is a compelling mission, a credible track record, and genuine relationships with funders who believe in your work.

The nonprofits that build sustainable grant programs don't treat each application as a transaction. They treat each funder as a long-term partner, each rejection as a learning opportunity, and each award as the beginning of a reporting and stewardship relationship — not the end of the process.

Start with the tools in this guide. Build the habits. And if you want to skip the manual search and let AI surface the best-fit opportunities for your specific mission automatically, [FundFish](https://fundfish.pro) was built exactly for that.
