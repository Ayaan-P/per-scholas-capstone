# How to Apply for HUD Grants: The Complete Guide for Nonprofits in 2026

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) distributes nearly $1 billion in grants annually to organizations working on affordable housing, homelessness prevention, community development, and fair housing initiatives. For nonprofits serving low-income communities, HUD grants represent one of the most significant federal funding opportunities available.

But here's the challenge: HUD's grant application process can feel overwhelming. Between SAM.gov registration, UEI requirements, NOFO documents, and Grants.gov submissions, many first-time applicants get lost before they even start.

This guide walks you through every step of the HUD grant application process—from determining your eligibility to submitting a competitive proposal. Whether you're applying for Continuum of Care funding, Community Development Block Grants, or Healthy Homes grants, you'll learn exactly what HUD expects and how to position your organization for success.

## What Are HUD Grants?

HUD grants are federal funding awards provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to support housing, community development, and fair housing programs across the United States. Unlike loans, grants don't need to be repaid—making them invaluable for nonprofits with limited capital.

HUD doesn't typically award grants directly to individuals. Instead, the agency works through local governments, public housing authorities, and nonprofit organizations to deliver financial assistance and services to eligible communities.

### Who Can Apply for HUD Grants?

Eligibility varies by program, but generally includes:

- **Nonprofit organizations** (501(c)(3) status typically required)
- **State and local governments**
- **Public Housing Authorities (PHAs)**
- **Tribal governments and tribally designated housing entities**
- **Community development corporations**
- **Faith-based organizations** (for certain programs)

For-profit entities are generally **not eligible** to apply for HUD grants or serve as subrecipients of grant funds.

## Major HUD Grant Programs for Nonprofits

Before diving into the application process, let's review the primary HUD grant programs available to nonprofits:

### Continuum of Care (CoC) Program

The CoC Program is HUD's largest competitive grant program for homeless services. It provides funding for:

- **Permanent supportive housing** for individuals with disabilities
- **Rapid re-housing** to quickly move people into permanent housing
- **Transitional housing** for up to 24 months
- **Supportive services** including outreach and coordinated entry
- **Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS)**

**Typical funding:** Varies by community, with larger metropolitan areas receiving tens of millions annually.

**Application timeline:** Usually opens in late summer/early fall with submissions due 60-90 days later.

### Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)

CDBG is a formula grant program—meaning funds are allocated based on population and need rather than competitive applications. However, nonprofits can access CDBG funding through subgrants from their local government.

Eligible activities include:
- Affordable housing development and rehabilitation
- Public facility improvements (including homeless shelters)
- Economic development and job creation
- Public services for low-income residents

**How nonprofits access CDBG:** Contact your city or county's community development department to inquire about subgrant opportunities.

### Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control Grants

These grants help organizations address housing-related health hazards:

- **Lead Hazard Reduction Grants:** Fund lead-based paint hazard identification and mitigation in pre-1978 housing
- **Healthy Homes Production Grants:** Address multiple health hazards including asthma triggers, carbon monoxide, and radon
- **Older Adult Home Modification Program:** Fund accessibility modifications for low-income seniors

**Eligible applicants:** State and local governments, nonprofits, and public housing authorities.

### Housing Counseling Grants

Funding for HUD-approved housing counseling agencies providing:
- Pre-purchase counseling
- Foreclosure prevention
- Rental assistance guidance
- Homeless services counseling

### Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP)

Grants for organizations enforcing fair housing laws through:
- Education and outreach
- Testing for housing discrimination
- Fair housing enforcement activities

### Other Notable Programs

- **Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA):** Housing assistance for people living with HIV/AIDS
- **Section 811 Supportive Housing:** Housing for people with disabilities
- **Rural Capacity Building Grants:** Support for rural community development
- **Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grants:** Comprehensive neighborhood transformation

## Step 1: Prepare Your Organization for HUD Grants

Before applying for any HUD grant, you need to complete several mandatory registration steps. Start this process **at least 6-8 weeks** before any grant deadline—registration delays are the most common reason applications fail.

### Obtain Your Unique Entity Identifier (UEI)

As of April 2022, the federal government replaced DUNS numbers with the Unique Entity Identifier (UEI). Every organization applying for federal grants must have an active UEI.

**How to get your UEI:**

1. Go to [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov)
2. Create a user account if you don't have one
3. Select "Get Started" under Entity Registration
4. Complete the entity validation process
5. Your 12-character UEI will be assigned upon successful validation

**Timeline:** UEI requests can take 7-10 business days, though it's often faster.

### Register with SAM.gov

The System for Award Management (SAM) is the federal government's official database of organizations authorized to receive federal awards. SAM registration is **mandatory** for all HUD grant applicants.

**SAM.gov registration steps:**

1. Go to [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov) and sign in with your Login.gov account
2. Select "Entity Registration"
3. Complete all required sections:
   - Core Data (legal business name, physical address, UEI)
   - Assertions (answers to eligibility questions)
   - Representations and Certifications
   - Points of Contact (designate your authorized representative)
4. Submit your registration for review

**Timeline:** New registrations typically take 7-10 business days but can take up to 3-4 weeks during peak periods.

**Critical:** Your SAM registration must remain active throughout the grant period. Set a calendar reminder to renew annually—registrations expire after one year.

### Register with Grants.gov

Grants.gov is the federal government's central portal for finding and applying for discretionary grants. All HUD competitive grants are submitted through this platform.

**Grants.gov registration steps:**

1. Go to [Grants.gov](https://grants.gov) and click "Register"
2. Select "Organization Applicant"
3. Add your organization using your UEI number
4. Designate an Authorized Organization Representative (AOR)
5. The AOR must complete authorization—this requires approval from your E-Business Point of Contact (registered in SAM.gov)

**Timeline:** 1-3 business days after your AOR requests authorization.

### Designate Your Authorized Organization Representative (AOR)

The AOR is the person who will officially submit grant applications on behalf of your organization. This should be someone with signature authority—typically an Executive Director, CFO, or Board-authorized staff member.

**Important:** Only your designated AOR can submit applications on Grants.gov. If your AOR leaves the organization, you'll need to update your designations in both SAM.gov and Grants.gov immediately.

## Step 2: Find HUD Funding Opportunities

Once your organization is registered, you can start identifying relevant funding opportunities.

### Where to Find HUD Grants

**1. HUD's Funding Opportunities Page**

Visit [hud.gov/grants](https://www.hud.gov/grants) for the official list of current and upcoming NOFOs. You can filter by program office and status (Published, Forecasted, Closed).

**2. Grants.gov Search**

Search Grants.gov using these filters:
- **Agency:** Department of Housing and Urban Development
- **Eligibility:** Nonprofits
- **Status:** Posted (for open opportunities)

**3. HUD Email Alerts**

Subscribe to HUD funding alerts at [hud.gov/subscribe](https://www.hud.gov/subscribe/signup?listname=HUD%20Funding%20Opportunities) to receive notifications when new NOFOs are published.

### Understanding the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO)

Every HUD competitive grant is governed by a NOFO—the official document containing everything you need to apply. The NOFO includes:

- **Program description and objectives**
- **Eligibility requirements**
- **Funding amounts and award limits**
- **Application requirements and forms**
- **Rating factors and scoring criteria**
- **Submission deadlines and procedures**

**Pro tip:** Read the entire NOFO before starting your application. Many applicants skip to the application forms and miss critical eligibility requirements or documentation that would disqualify their submission.

HUD NOFOs typically reference a "General Section" that applies to all HUD grants and a "Program Section" with specific requirements. Both sections are equally important.

## Step 3: Prepare Your Application

HUD grant applications require extensive documentation. Start gathering materials as soon as you identify a funding opportunity.

### Common Required Documents

While requirements vary by program, most HUD applications require:

**Organizational documents:**
- IRS determination letter (501(c)(3) status)
- Articles of incorporation
- Organizational bylaws
- Board member list with affiliations
- Audited financial statements (usually 1-2 years)

**Program documents:**
- Project narrative addressing all rating factors
- Logic model or theory of change
- Evaluation plan with measurable outcomes
- Letters of commitment from partners
- Resumes of key personnel

**Financial documents:**
- Detailed line-item budget
- Budget narrative justifying each expense
- Evidence of matching funds (if required)
- Cost allocation plan
- Indirect cost rate agreement (if claiming indirect costs)

### Standard Forms

Most HUD applications require these federal standard forms:

- **SF-424:** Application for Federal Assistance (basic application information)
- **SF-424A:** Budget Information (Non-Construction Programs)
- **SF-424B:** Assurances (Non-Construction Programs)
- **SF-LLL:** Disclosure of Lobbying Activities
- **HUD-2880:** Applicant/Recipient Disclosure/Update Report
- **HUD-96011:** Facsimile Transmittal (Third Party Documentation)

### Writing Your Project Narrative

The project narrative is where you make your case for funding. HUD applications are scored competitively, and your narrative must address every rating factor listed in the NOFO.

**Key principles for strong narratives:**

**1. Address every rating factor explicitly**

Don't make reviewers hunt for information. Use headings that match the NOFO's rating factor language.

**2. Be specific with data**

Instead of "many people in our community are homeless," write "According to the 2025 Point-in-Time Count, our jurisdiction has 847 individuals experiencing homelessness, a 12% increase from 2024."

**3. Demonstrate capacity**

Show that your organization has successfully managed similar grants. Reference past performance, staff expertise, and organizational infrastructure.

**4. Define measurable outcomes**

Use SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. HUD reviewers want to see exactly what success looks like and how you'll track it.

**5. Connect to HUD's priorities**

Review HUD's current strategic plan and reference how your project advances agency priorities. Currently, HUD emphasizes equity, climate resilience, and reducing homelessness.

### Preparing Your Budget

Your budget must align with your narrative. Every activity described in your narrative should have corresponding budget line items, and every expense in your budget should be justified by activities in your narrative.

**Budget best practices:**

- Use HUD's required budget format if provided
- Include detailed calculations showing how you arrived at each amount
- Ensure all costs are allowable under 2 CFR Part 200 (Uniform Guidance)
- Document any matching funds or cost-sharing commitments
- Include realistic indirect cost rates (HUD allows up to 10% for many programs)

## Step 4: Submit Your Application

Grants.gov is the only accepted submission method for HUD competitive grants. Paper applications are not accepted except in rare cases with approved waivers.

### Submission Timeline

**At least 5-7 days before deadline:**
- Complete your application package
- Verify all required attachments are included
- Check file formats (PDF is typically required)
- Verify file size limits (Grants.gov has upload limits)

**At least 2-3 days before deadline:**
- Have your AOR log into Grants.gov
- Upload your application package
- Submit the application
- Download and save your confirmation receipt

**Why submit early?** Grants.gov experiences heavy traffic near deadlines. Technical issues can prevent last-minute submissions, and HUD cannot accept late applications regardless of technical problems.

### Common Technical Issues

- **File name problems:** Use only alphanumeric characters and underscores. Avoid spaces and special characters.
- **File size limits:** Individual files are typically limited to 10-200 MB depending on the form.
- **PDF formatting:** Some forms require specific PDF versions. Use Adobe Acrobat if possible.
- **Browser issues:** Grants.gov works best with Chrome or Edge. Safari users often encounter problems.

### After Submission

Grants.gov will email you a confirmation receipt with a tracking number. Log into Grants.gov within 24-48 hours to verify your application status shows "Received by Agency."

If your status shows "Rejected," you may have time to correct errors and resubmit before the deadline. Check the rejection notice for specific issues.

## Step 5: The Review Process

After submission, HUD reviews applications through a multi-stage process:

**1. Eligibility screening:** HUD verifies your organization is eligible and your application is complete.

**2. Technical review:** Staff review for compliance with submission requirements.

**3. Merit review:** Subject matter experts score applications against rating factors.

**4. Program office review:** HUD staff review top-scoring applications and make funding recommendations.

**5. Award decisions:** HUD leadership approves final awards.

**Timeline:** Review typically takes 3-6 months depending on the program and volume of applications.

## Common HUD Grant Application Mistakes

Avoid these frequent errors that lead to rejected or low-scoring applications:

### 1. Missing the deadline

Grants.gov closes at 11:59 PM Eastern on the deadline date. No extensions are granted for any reason.

### 2. Incomplete SAM.gov registration

Your SAM registration must be active when you submit. Expired registrations cause automatic rejection.

### 3. Failing to follow the NOFO

Not addressing every required element, exceeding page limits, or using wrong file formats.

### 4. Vague or unsupported goals

Reviewers want specific, measurable outcomes backed by data—not general statements about helping the community.

### 5. Budget/narrative mismatch

If your narrative describes activities that aren't budgeted (or vice versa), reviewers will question your planning.

### 6. Missing required attachments

Double-check that every required document is uploaded before submitting.

### 7. Not addressing all rating factors

Each rating factor has a point value. Leaving any factor unaddressed means leaving points on the table.

### 8. Insufficient match documentation

If the NOFO requires matching funds, you must document committed sources—not just state your intent to find them.

## Tips for a Competitive HUD Application

### Build relationships before applying

Connect with your local HUD Field Office, Continuum of Care, and public housing authority. Understanding local priorities helps you craft stronger applications.

### Partner strategically

Collaborative applications often score higher. Partner with organizations that complement your strengths and fill gaps in your capacity.

### Request feedback on rejected applications

HUD will share reviewer feedback upon request. Use this information to strengthen future applications.

### Start early

Begin preparing your application the day the NOFO is released. Quality applications take 6-8 weeks of focused work.

### Attend HUD webinars

HUD hosts technical assistance webinars for most grant programs. These free sessions clarify requirements and answer applicant questions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does HUD grant registration take?

Plan for 4-8 weeks to complete all required registrations (UEI, SAM.gov, Grants.gov). Individual steps can take 1-3 weeks each.

### Can small nonprofits apply for HUD grants?

Yes, but organizational capacity is a rating factor. Smaller organizations may benefit from partnering with more established agencies or applying through their Continuum of Care.

### What's the difference between formula and competitive grants?

Formula grants (like CDBG and ESG) are allocated based on population and need—you don't compete for them. Competitive grants (like CoC and FHIP) are awarded based on application scores.

### How much funding can we request?

Each NOFO specifies minimum and maximum award amounts. Request what you can realistically manage while staying within program limits.

### Can we apply for multiple HUD grants?

Yes, you can apply for multiple programs simultaneously. However, ensure you have capacity to manage all grants if awarded.

### What if our application is rejected?

Rejection isn't permanent. Address the issues that caused rejection and apply again in the next funding cycle. Many successful grantees were rejected on their first attempt.

### Does HUD fund capital projects?

Some HUD programs fund acquisition, rehabilitation, and new construction. Check specific NOFO requirements—capital projects often have additional compliance requirements.
