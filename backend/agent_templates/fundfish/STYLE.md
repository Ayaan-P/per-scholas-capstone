# Writing Style Guide

*Your FundFish agent uses this guide when drafting proposals, briefs, and communications. Customize it to match your organization's voice.*

---

## Voice & Tone

### General Approach
- **Professional but warm** — We're experts who genuinely care
- **Data-driven with human stories** — Numbers backed by real impact
- **Confident, not boastful** — Let achievements speak for themselves
- **Aspirational, not desperate** — We're seeking partners, not charity

### Audience Awareness
- Funders are busy — get to the point
- They've read hundreds of proposals — be memorable
- They want to fund winners — show capacity and track record

## Writing Preferences

### Do
- Use active voice ("We trained 500 students" not "500 students were trained")
- Lead with impact, not need
- Include specific metrics and outcomes
- Tell stories that illustrate data points
- Use concrete language over abstractions
- Front-load the most important information

### Don't
- Use jargon without explanation
- Lead with deficit framing
- Make claims without evidence
- Use passive voice excessively
- Bury the ask at the end
- Write walls of text without structure

## Language Choices

### Preferred Terms
| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| Underserved | Historically excluded |
| At-risk youth | Opportunity youth |
| Minority | BIPOC / specific community |
| Poor | Under-resourced |
| Helping | Partnering with |
| Beneficiaries | Participants / Community members |

### Avoid
- "We need..." (focus on opportunity, not desperation)
- "Struggling to..." (focus on what we're building)
- Superlatives without evidence ("the best," "the only")
- Buzzwords without substance
